### Overview
Below you will find information on the options and behavior of each filter, as well as an example of how to use it. Keep in mind that while most of the examples simply show how the filter is used on its own, each filter can be combined together to create very complexed selections. The `merge filter` example demonstrates this

### Inverting Filters
Most filters have an option to invert them. This can be used to do the exact opposite of what the filter would normally do!<br/>
Example: Inverting a `Collection` filter would cause it to include any games **not in** that collection, instead of **in** it.

<br/>


### Available Filters

#### Collection
**Options:**<br/>
`collection` - The collection to use.

**Behavior:**<br/>
Filters games based on if they are included in the collection.

<br/>

#### Installed
**Options:**<br/>
`installed` - A toggle. On is `installed`, off is `uninstalled`.

<br/>

#### Regex
**Options:**<br/>
`regex` - The regular expression to use.

**Behavior:**<br/>
Filters games by testing if their title matches a regular expression .

**Tip:**<br/>
Regular expressions can seem daunting and confusing. You can test yours before hand by looking up a "Regex Tester" website.<br/>
Also, by typing a phrase like "Zelda" into the regex field, it will include any game with that phrase in its title.

**Example:**<br/>
<img title="Regex Example" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tormak9970/TabMaster/master/assets/docs_regex-example.png" />

<br/>

#### Merge
**Options:**<br/>
`filters` - The filters for this group.
`logic mode` - Specifies whether to use `and` vs. `or` mode.

**Behavior:**<br/>
Groups a set of filters, allowing you to change the logic mode for smaller sets of filters.

**Tip:**<br/>
By grouping filters you are able to specify the mode for filters in the group seperately, significantly increasing the utility of TabMaster
