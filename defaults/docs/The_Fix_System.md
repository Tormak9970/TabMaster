### What is the Fix System?
The fix system is TabMaster's solution for tough situations, where the plugin is unable to automatically fix issues. In these cases, we thought it best to leave the decision of what to do up to you, the user.<br/>
**Causes:**
 - Deleting a collection used as a filter

<br/>


### How to use the Fix System
We've tried to make this system as simple and easy to use as possible. When an issue that would break TabMaster occurs, it will show the fix system window, and let you know what went wrong.<br/>
**Note!**: You need to fix the issue! If you don't TabMaster will not work, and will show the fix system each time you log in until you fix it!

#### Fixing a Filter
To fix a filter, simply set its options to new values, or remove it completely. TabMaster will update the filter according to your changes when you save.<br/>

#### Fixing a Filter in a Group
In order to fix a filter in a merge group, you need to open the group. Once done, you can fix it just like a regular filter.
