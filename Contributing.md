# Coding Conventions

When writing code for TabMaster, you should ensure the following:
 - Use 2 space tabs
 - Always use semi-colons. Just because TypeScript lets you skip them, doesn't mean you should
 - Do no use the "any" type unless absolutely necessary (patching is exempt from this)
 - For variables, use camelCase for TypeScript, snake_case for Python
 - Functions should not be anonymous (aka arrow functions) unless they are components or it is necessary
 - Add JSDoc comments to functions


# Commits

We use commitlint to ensure that our commits are short, readable, and easy to convert into a changelog. Husky will validate your commit messages before you push a commit to help you make sure it is up to standard.<br/>
Here's what you need to know:
 - no uppercase letters or special characters
 - commit must have one of the following prefixes:
   - fix - bug fixes
   - feat - new features
   - style - styling changes
   - chore - code cleanup, progress on something, etc
   - ci - changes to the ci
   - build - build pipeline/release related
   - docs - changes to the documentation
   - refactor - refactoring
 - when writing a good commit message, keep it short. You can always add details in the commit description
