### Overview
Here you can find everything about tabs, including adding, availale options, reordering, hiding, and deleting them.

<br/>


### Custom vs. Default
Before you continue, it is important to understand that there are two types of tabs, default tabs (marked with the Steam logo) and custom tabs (ones you make). Default tabs can only be hidden, while custom tabs have all the following features.

<br/>


### The TabMaster Context Menu

<br/>
The TabMaster context menu aims to provide access to all of TabMaster's features straight from the library page. Simply navigate to a tab in the library header, and hit the menu button to open the context menu.

<br/>


### Quick Tabs

<br/>
Quick Tabs are premade tabs that allow you to quickly generate a new tab for a variety of use cases. They are modifiable just like a regular tab as well.

<br/>


### Adding Tabs

<br/>
This is where you can add new tabs to your library. You can find the various options explained below.

#### Options:

**Name** - The name of the tab (This will show up in your Steam Library).

**Include** - The types of apps to include (defaults to games).

**Auto Hide** - Whether this tab should automatically be hidden from the library when it has no games (this preserves the order of the tabs, unlike hiding it manually).

**Logic Mode** - Two modes, `And` (apps must match all filters) and `Or` (apps must match at least one filter).

**Filters** - The filters for this tab. More details on these can be found on the next page.

<br/>


### Editing Tabs

#### Changing Tabs (Custom Tabs Only)

<br/>
To get to this menu, focus the tab you want to reorder in the QAM (Quick Access Menu), and hit `A` to open the tab's options. If the tab is a custom tab, you will see an `Edit` option, select that. You will see the same options as when you add a tab. You can edit any of these and the tab will update once you save.

<br/>

#### Reordering Tabs

<br/>
Reordering a tab is just as straightforward. Simply focus the tab you want to reorder in the QAM. Hit `X`, and use the left joystick to move the tab up/down in the order. Once you are satisfied, hit `X` again to save.

<br/>

#### Hiding Tabs
Tabs can be hidden from the library as well. This means they won't appear in your library, but you don't have to completely delete them. This option is found in the same menu as the `edit` option from earlier.

<br/>


### Removing Tabs (Custom Tabs Only)
If you decide your custom tab just isn't cutting it, you can completely remove it too. To do this, navigate to the tab's menu (the same one where you edit and hide tabs), and click `delete`. You will be prompted to confirm (as this can't be undone!), and once you do, the tab will be perminantly removed from TabMaster.
