Made a mistake while making a profile, or just decide something needed to change? Well its easy to overwrite profiles, just open the profiles menu and navigate to the profile you want to delete and click "Y". A window will show up comparing what's in the profile, to what you're overwriting it with, allowing you to see the changes that will be made. Simply confirm here, and the profile will be overwritten.

### Deleting Profiles
Decide you don't like a profile anymore? Well deleting it is easy too! Just open the same Tab Profiles menu, and navigate to the profile you want to delete and click "X". You will be prompted to confirm if you really want to delete the profile, and confirming will delete it.
